Data Project - Stock Market Analysis-Pharmacy Companies

In this portfolio project we will be looking at data from the stock market, particularly some farmacy company stocks. We will learn how to use pandas to get stock information, visualize different aspects of it, and finally we will look at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. We will also be predicting future stock prices through a Monte Carlo method!

We'll be answering the following questions along the way:

1.) What was the change in price of the stock over time? 2.) What was the daily return of the stock on average? 3.) What was the moving average of the various stocks? 4.) What was the correlation between different stocks' closing prices? 4.) What was the correlation between different stocks' daily returns? 5.) How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock? 6.) How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior?


Data-Project---Election-Analysis

Data Project - Election Analysis #Election Data Project - Polls and Donors

In this Data Project we will be looking at data from the 2012 election.

In this project we will analyze two datasets. The first data set will be the results of political polls. We will analyze this aggregated poll data and answer some questions:

1.) Who was being polled and what was their party affiliation? 2.) Did the poll results favor Romney or Obama? 3.) How do undecided voters effect the poll? 4.) Can we account for the undecided voters? 5.) How did voter sentiment change over time? 6.) Can we see an effect in the polls from the debates?

We'll discuss the second data set later on!
